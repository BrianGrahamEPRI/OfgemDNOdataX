# OfgemDNOdataX
Developing the UK DNO data exchange for planning network models (LTDS) in accordance with CIM.

## Disclaimer
This github repository is being used by the working group to collaboratively develop and define the data exchange format. Please note that all models and standard definitions in this repository are in DRAFT form and are in constant development. Test model files represent samples of the GB distribution network and should not be used as a source of information for the network. They are intented to illustrate the data format, and they may contain false or misleading values for network attributes or equipment locations.

## Introduction
In August 2021, Ofgem initiated an effort to reform the exchange of planning data from the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in Great Britain. This data exchange is currently licensed by the Long Term Development Statement (LTDS) and the corresponding Form of Statement that describes the data that must be reported by each DNO, originally published in 2011. The purpose of this data exchange is to make DNO network data publicly available so that potential customers can evaluate the implications of connecting to the network at all locations in current and future years (0-5 years). Another use-case of this data exchange is to make distribution network data publicly available to facilitate development of innovative services of any kind including flexility services and 3rd party analytic services etc. 

Ofgem convened a working group consisting of representattives from end-users, and GB DNOs with the following goals:
* Re-evaluate the scope of the data exchange and ensure it is fit for purpose
* Standarise this data exchange into a common format such that all DNO data can be analysed using the same tools and methods
* Leverage the Common Information Model (CIM) as an international standard to encourage interoperability with Transmission models and other GB data exchanges

# Contents of this repository
The folder 'Profile development' contains UML files (.eap) and summary documentation (.xlsx) which describe the format of the data exchange and specify the structure, syntax and semantics of how data may be exchanged.
The folder 'Test models' contains a number of sample network models (.xml) described according to this exchange standard.
