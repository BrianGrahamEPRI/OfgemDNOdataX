## Pilot Grid Instance Model

This folder contains the following files:
- **MaidstoneFoundational.xml** is the pilot grid instance model that contains a representation of the Maidstone network in the proposed LTDS format. This version of the model contains only the information described in the Foundational Modelling Guidelines and will be augmented as the wg adds more scope to the LTDS data in future iterations. 
- **MaidstoneFoundationalSLD** is the single-line diagram of the model created from Cimphony.
- **Maidstone_GL.xml** is an xml file that contains only the geogrpahica information for the model. CIM allows you to separate this information using the 'GL' profile and this file illustrates how it is exchanged.
- **Maidstone_DL.xml** is an xml file that contains only the diagram layout information for the model. CIM allows you to separate this information using the 'DL' (Diagram Layout) profile and this file illustrates how it is exchanged. The DL data is exchanged so that different applications can produce diagrams in the same way for a given model.

Hopefully these artifacts will be useful examples to DNOs as they create the models of portions of their grids and to users as they start working on importing the pilot grid instance model. This version of the model contains only the information described in the Foundational Modelling Guidelines and will be augmented as the wg adds more scope to the LTDS data in future iterations. 

**Please note that this model is not intended to serve as a source of truth for the UKPN network â€“ the original data has been modified to illustrate the requirements for the reformed LTDS.**
